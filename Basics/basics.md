# Basic Knowledge About Data Mining Is Important

## What is Data Mining? (Explained Like I'm 5)
Looking for patterns in large amounts of data. The process of extracting information and knowledge from data is what data mining is. Data mining is digging though tons of random looking data looking for the pieces of information that is worth anything. Essentially, going through raw data and finding trends within.

## What is Knowledge Discovery from Data? (KDD)
Process of discovering useful knowledge from a collection of data. The knowledge discovery process is as an iterative sequence of the following steps:
	1. Data cleaning: Remove noise and inconsistent data
	2. Data integration: Multiple data sources may be combined
	3. Data selection: Data relevant to the analysis are retrieved from the database
	4. Data transformation: Data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining   	 by performing summary or aggregation operations
	5. Data mining: Intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns
	6. Pattern evaluation: Identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on 	   interestingness measures
	7. Knowledge presentation: Visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used        	to resent mined knowledge to users
