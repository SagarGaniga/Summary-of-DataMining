# Basic Knowledge About Data Mining Is Important

## What is Data Mining? (Explained Like I'm 5)
Looking for patterns in large amounts of data. The process of extracting information and knowledge from data is what data mining is. Data mining is digging though tons of random looking data looking for the pieces of information that is worth anything. Essentially, going through raw data and finding trends within.

## What is Knowledge Discovery from Data? (KDD)
Process of discovering useful knowledge from a collection of data. The knowledge discovery process is as an iterative sequence of the following steps:

	1. Data cleaning: Remove noise and inconsistent data

	2. Data integration: Multiple data sources may be combined
	
	3. Data selection: Data relevant to the analysis are retrieved from the database
	
	4. Data transformation: Data are transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate
	by performing summary or aggregation operations
	
	5. Data mining: Intelligent methods are applied to extract data patterns
	
	6. Pattern evaluation: Identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based interestingness measures
	
	7. Knowledge presentation: Visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to resent mined knowledge to users

## What Kinds of Data Can Be Mined?
	
	1. Database data: tables and stuffs

	2. Data Warehouse

	3. Transactional Data: such as a customer’s purchase, a flight booking, or a user’s clicks on web page


## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence in which the program is designed to learn on its own. Machine Learning is a way of programming a computer to learn to do a task on its own, rather than you having to implicitly tell it how to accomplish the task. Machine learning investigates how computers can learn (or improve their performance) based on data. 

## Type of Data Attributes

	1. Nominal Attributes: 

		a. The values of a nominal attribute are symbols or names of things.

		b. Each value represents some kind of category, code, or state, and so nominal attributes are also referred to as categorical. 

		c. In computer science, the values are also known as enumerations.

		d. That is, mathematical operations on values of nominal attributes are not meaningful

		e. Example: Hair color and Marital Status 

	2. Binary Attributes

		a. only two categories or states: 0 or 1, where 0 typically means that the attribute is absent, and 1 means that it is present.

		b. The attribute medical test is binary, where a value of 1 means the result of the test for the patient is positive, while 0 means the result is negative.

	3. Ordinal Attributes

		a. Values that have a meaningful order or ranking among them, but the magnitude between successive values is not known

		b. Ordinal attributes are useful for registering subjective assessments of qualities that cannot be measured objectively; thus ordinal attributes are often used in surveys for ratings

		c. Customer satisfaction had the following ordinal categories: 
			0: very dissatisfied, 1: somewhat dissatisfied, 2: neutral, 3: satisfied, and 4: very satisfied

		d. The central tendency of an ordinal attribute can be represented by its mode and its median (the middle value in an ordered sequence), but the mean cannot be defined

	4. Numeric Attributes

		a. A numeric attribute is quantitative; that is, it is a measurable quantity, represented in
		integer or real values.

		b. Numeric attributes can be interval-scaled or ratio-scaled.

		c. Interval-scaled attributes are measured on a scale of equal-size units. The values of interval-scaled attributes have order and can be positive, 0, or negative.

		d. A temperature attribute is interval-scaled

		e. A ratio-scaled attribute is a numeric attribute with an inherent zero-point. That is, if a measurement is ratio-scaled, we can speak of a value as being a multiple (or ratio) of another value

		f. count attributes such as years of experience (e.g., the objects are employees) and number of words (e.g., the objects are documents).
