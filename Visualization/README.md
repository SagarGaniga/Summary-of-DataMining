# Graphic Displays of Basic Statistical Descriptions of Data

Graphical display of data is helpful in visual inspection of data, which is useful for data preprocessing. 

Here, in the Jupyter Notebook I have described various types of graphs which are used for visualization.

Some of them are:
	
	1. Scatter Plots

	2. Histograms

	3. Correlation Matrix etc

There are several representative approaches as well. I have discussed many of them in the Notebook like:

	1. Pixel-Oriented Visualization Techniques

	2. Geometric Projection Visualization Techniques

	3. Icon-Based Visualization Techniques

	4. Tag Cloud
